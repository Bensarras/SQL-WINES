Wine Sales Data Analysis
Project Overview
Welcome to my Wine Sales Data Analysis project. This project dives into a rich dataset of wine sales, exploring various aspects of customer buying patterns, wine preferences, sales trends, and more. Utilizing the power of SQL, I have transformed raw sales data into meaningful insights, uncovering the stories hidden within numbers.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Validation: Ensured data integrity by cleaning and validating the dataset, including handling duplicates, null values, and incorrect entries.
Advanced SQL Queries: Leveraged complex SQL queries to analyze sales trends, customer behaviors, and wine preferences.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzed customer purchase patterns to segment customers based on buying behavior.
Sales Trend Analysis: Investigated how different factors like wine type, bottle size, and region affect sales.
Predictive Analysis: Applied basic predictive models to forecast future sales trends (if applicable).
Performance Optimization: Implemented query optimization techniques for efficient data retrieval.
Technologies Used
MySQL: For database management and SQL queries.
MySQL Workbench: As the primary interface for running SQL scripts and managing the database.

Dataset
The dataset for this project includes a range of variables such as Product_ID, Wine_Type, Size_Type, Country, Customer_ID, Order_Date, and more. It captures intricate details about wine sales, customer demographics, and purchasing behaviors.

Key Insights
Most Popular Wine: Identified the most frequently purchased wine type and its size.
Customer with the Most Orders: Highlighted the customer who placed the most orders.
Sales Patterns: Uncovered seasonal trends and patterns in wine purchasing.
Future Enhancements
Integration with a data visualization tool for interactive reporting.
Expansion of the dataset to include additional years for longitudinal analysis.
Application of more sophisticated statistical techniques for deeper insights.
